## Magnetic Attachment

Instead of using the attachment that ship with the blinds, I've opted for magnetic attachment.

Since the blinds themselves are not magnetic, they're made from aluminium, I've attached metal bars to them
and then screwed magnets into my window. This works very well and make for a quick and easy release mechanism.

**Details:** 
- Cut metal bar into pieces and drill holes with `11/64"` drill then widen top of the hole using `1/4"`. Use file to smoothen any sharp edges.
- Attach metal bar to the blinds (pre-drill screw holes) using `5 x 1` screws.
- Attach magnets to window (pre-drill screen holes)
